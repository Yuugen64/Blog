7.29.21:
- Initialized the repo.
- [000-0.0.0]:: Initial Commit >> Updated the readme with my standard format. Verifying Git pipeline.
- [001-0.0.1]:: ReactJS Template >> Created the ReactJS template inside of a sub-directory since capital letters are no longer allowed inside of project names.-
- [002-0.0.2]:: Cleaned Up >> Removed some of the unnecessary bits that come pre-packaged with ReactJS template.
- [003-0.0.3]:: Menubar >> Got a basic skeleton of a menubar together. Also put together a basic color palette.
- [004-0.0.3]:: Local Image >> Got a local image rendering properly in ReactJS.
- [005-0.0.3]:: BUGFIX >> When using Font-Awesome (FA) icons in ReactJS you need to remember to substitute the default syntax of 'class' for the icons with React's syntax 'className'. Doing so allows the CSS to actually apply to the icons.
